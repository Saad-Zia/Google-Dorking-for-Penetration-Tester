# How to Host a Website?

Hi! I'm **Saad Zia**. I am web penetration tester and bug hunter @Hackerone and @bugcrowd.

Hosting a website simply means making sure that your website can be accessible on the World Wide Web (WWW). This can be done in two ways. You can: 
   - Host a website with web hosting company
   - Host it yourself at your own server
 
 We will look into both methods.
 
 # How to Host a Website With Hosing Provider?
 
 Here are the five steps to host a website with a hosting service provider; 
 
    1) Buy a domain name
    2) Decide which types of website you are building
    3) Choose a website hosting company
    4) Select a web hosting plan
    5) Move your website to the server


- **Buy a domain name**
     - Any website needs a name. Therefore, the first step is to register a domain name for your future website. The name of the website will become its permanent address where users can find it on the Internet.
     
- **Decide which types of websites you are building**    
  
         - 1) Static
         - 2) Dynamic
 
    - A static website delivers the same page and content to all users.
Examples include blogs, portfolio websites, and business websites. Static sites can usually take a more basic web hosting plan as they require less storage space and server resources.
    
    - A dynamic website displays adaptive content that varies for each visitor based on their site settings or user behavior. Such as Social networking sites, eCommerce sites, and subscription-based websites like Netflix.
Therefore, dynamic sites often need a more comprehensive and customizable hosting plan with increased storage space, memory, and bandwidth.

- **Choose a webite hosting company**

Once you’ve had a look at the top hosting companies, you need to pick one! There are a number of features you should consider when choosing a website hosting company.
We’ve provided an overview of these. Below are some of the key factors to consider:

   1) Uptime Guarantee
        - First things first, you want to make sure your website is available 24/7/365. The last thing you want your visitors to see is a blank screen when they type in your address into their browser. Look for a hosting provider with an uptime guarantee of 99.5% or above. If you plan on running a small website with modest traffic levels, uptime might never be an issue. However, if your website grows, uptime is incredibly important so you can avoid any downtime or upgrade complications.
 
   2) Redundancy
      - When a small website goes down due to hosting provider problems, it might bounce back unaffected. When downtime happens to a business that relies on their website as their main source of income, this can result in revenue loss. So when a hosting provider offers "redundancy," this simply means they'll compensate a website if an outage occurs as a result of server issues on their side.
