# How to Host a Website?

Hi! I'm **Saad Zia**. I am web penetration tester and bug hunter @Hackerone and @bugcrowd.

Hosting a website simply means making sure that your website can be accessible on the World Wide Web (WWW). This can be done in two ways. You can: 
   - Host a website with web hosting company
   - Host it yourself at your own server
 
 We will look into both methods.
 
 # How to Host a Website With Hosing Provider?
 
Here are the five steps to host a website with a hosting service provider; 
 
1) Buy a domain name
2) Decide which types of website you are building
3) Choose a website hosting company
4) Select a web hosting plan
5) Move your website to the server


- **Buy a domain name**
     - Any website needs a name. Therefore, the first step is to register a domain name for your future website. The name of the website will become its permanent address where users can find it on the Internet.
     
- **Decide which types of websites you are building**    
  
  1) Static
  2) Dynamic
 
    - A static website delivers the same page and content to all users.
Examples include blogs, portfolio websites, and business websites. Static sites can usually take a more basic web hosting plan as they require less storage space and server resources.
    
    - A dynamic website displays adaptive content that varies for each visitor based on their site settings or user behavior. Such as Social networking sites, eCommerce sites, and subscription-based websites like Netflix.
Therefore, dynamic sites often need a more comprehensive and customizable hosting plan with increased storage space, memory, and bandwidth.

- **Choose a webite hosting company**

Once you’ve had a look at the top hosting companies, you need to pick one! There are a number of features you should consider when choosing a website hosting company.
We’ve provided an overview of these. Below are some of the key factors to consider:

   1) Uptime Guarantee
        - First things first, you want to make sure your website is available 24/7/365. The last thing you want your visitors to see is a blank screen when they type in your address into their browser. Look for a hosting provider with an uptime guarantee of 99.5% or above. If you plan on running a small website with modest traffic levels, uptime might never be an issue. However, if your website grows, uptime is incredibly important so you can avoid any downtime or upgrade complications.
 
   2) Redundancy
      - When a small website goes down due to hosting provider problems, it might bounce back unaffected. When downtime happens to a business that relies on their website as their main source of income, this can result in revenue loss. So when a hosting provider offers "redundancy," this simply means they'll compensate a website if an outage occurs as a result of server issues on their side.

   3) Database Type
      - The most common type of database used by WordPress and other content management systems (CMS) is MySQL. Some websites require other databases, such as SQLite, so check what type your website needs first and then see if it's available with your respective hosting provider.

   4) Bandwidth Offering
      - Bandwidth is an indicator of the amount of data (or traffic) that has been transferred between the website and users during the customer’s interaction with your resource. To determine what type of hosting you need, think about what your website will be like. If you plan to rely on media materials, e.g. video clips or advertising videos, audio recordings, or even intend to broadcast to your audience in real time, you should definitely consider plans with a higher bandwidth quota of up to 150 GB per month. Website owners who rely mainly on text content and use additional platforms to store their podcasts, movies and images, in most cases, a basic 10 GB will be enough.
 
   5) 24/7 Customer Service
      - Hosting is a rather complex product. A lot of things can happen behind the scenes and are invisible to ordinary users. That is why 24/7 support is a huge advantage for any hosting provider. The ability to get help from your provider, at any time, and in a form that’s convenient for you (chat, correspondence, phone call to hotline) should be considered as a very important factor when choosing a hosting plan.

   6) Backups
      - Why perform a backup yourself when your hosting provider can take care of them for you? In case the unexpected happens and your website gets attacked by hackers or your computer system shuts down, it's best to run regular backups to have a recent version of your website to revert back to. Solid hosting providers offer backups every 24 hours, so in the rare event that something goes wrong, you'll be in safe hands.
  
  7) Guaranteed Security 
     - Cyber-attacks pose a threat to websites of all sizes. As most types of cyberattacks target web servers, hosting your website on a secure server is essential. A good web hosting provider must have clear and comprehensive cybersecurity protocols. 

Here are some of the best security practices a hosting company should follow:  

1) SSL
2) Web application firewall
3) Software updates
4) Network monitoring
5) Antivirus and malware removal
6) Denial-of-service (DDoS) prevention
7) Access restriction
