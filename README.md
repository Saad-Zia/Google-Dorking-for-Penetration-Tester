# How to Host a Website?

Hi! I'm **Saad Zia**. I am web penetration tester and bug hunter @Hackerone and @bugcrowd.

Hosting a website simply means making sure that your website can be accessible on the World Wide Web (WWW). This can be done in two ways. You can: 
   - Host a website with web hosting company
   - Host it yourself at your own server
 
 We will look into both methods.
 
 # How to Host a Website With Hosing Provider?
 
 Here are the five steps to host a website with a hosting service provider.
   - Buy a domain name
   - Decide which types of website you are building
   - Choose a website hosting company
   - Select a web hosting plan
   - Move your website to the server


- **Buy a domain name**
     - Any website needs a name. Therefore, the first step is to register a domain name for your future website. The name of the website will become its permanent address where users can find it on the Internet.
     
- **Decide which types of websites you are building**    
  
         - **Static**
         - **Dynamic**
 
    - A static website delivers the same page and content to all users.
Examples include blogs, portfolio websites, and business websites. Static sites can usually take a more basic web hosting plan as they require less storage space and server resources.
    
    - A dynamic website displays adaptive content that varies for each visitor based on their site settings or user behavior. Such as Social networking sites, eCommerce sites, and subscription-based websites like Netflix.
Therefore, dynamic sites often need a more comprehensive and customizable hosting plan with increased storage space, memory, and bandwidth.
